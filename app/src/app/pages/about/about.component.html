            <h2>Ruchira Dias</h2>
            <p>Ruchira Dias is a final year BSc Computer Science undergraduate student at the University of Westminster and a student at the Informatics Institute of Technology. As part of her final year project, Ruchira has created a machine learning model for motor insurance customer risk prediction specifically for the Sri Lankan insurance industry. This model involves collecting and analyzing data such as the driving record, age, and the make and model of the customer's vehicle to calculate a risk score. The model aims to assist insurance companies in better assessing customer risk, allowing for more personalized policies and pricing. Ruchira's project highlights the growing importance of data analytics and machine learning in the insurance industry, enabling insurers to improve accuracy and fairness in premium pricing. Her work is a testament to the potential for young talent in Sri Lanka to drive innovation in technology and contribute to the development of the country's economy..</p>
